      <h1>User Roles for PRMS Reporting Tool</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="info_title">Lead:</p>

        <p class="info_desc">
          The Lead is the proactive actor responsible for overseeing the approval of result indicators or requesting
          revisions. If
          the submission is successful, the results are forwarded for Quality Assurance (QA) processing.
        </p>

        <p class="info_title">Co-lead:</p>

        <p class="info_desc">
          The Co-lead serves as the Lead's right-hand person and plays an active role in reviewing and verifying all
          created
          results within their initiative. Additionally, they have the authority to approve result indicators or request
          revisions. Successful submissions are subsequently sent for Quality Assurance (QA) processing.
        </p>

        <p class="info_title">Coordinator:</p>

        <p class="info_desc">
          The Coordinator is a designated representative of the PRMS Initiative, chosen by the Initiative itself. This
          role
          ensures that information is accurately and punctually added to the system. They possess the authority to make
          necessary
          changes and can act on behalf of the Work Package Leads and Lead, including approving results and forwarding
          them for
          Quality Assurance (QA).
        </p>

        <p class="info_title">Member:</p>

        <p class="info_desc">
          The Member role acts as the right hand to both the Lead and Co-lead, actively participating in the process of
          populating
          all necessary information within the created results. This role is primarily responsible for creating results
          and
          inputting all relevant data. Subsequently, the Member role should signal the Lead or Co-lead to review the
          generated
          result for further evaluation.
        </p>

        <p class="info_title">Admin:</p>

        <p class="info_desc">
          The admin role in PRMS has full access to all reporting tool features. Typically, admins are members of the
          PPU/PCU.
          this role enter the result indicators for their center and/or work project (WP). The admin can make changes
          and
          act on
          behalf of the WP leads. For example, they can also approve results and send them to QA (Quality Assurance).
          Additionally, the admin can approve result indicators or send them back for revision and phase management. In
          addition
          to this, the admin can report a result in a new phase and update a result for a previous phase, which avoids
          delays in
          reporting previously created results.
        </p>

        <p class="info_title">Guest:</p>

        <p class="info_desc">
