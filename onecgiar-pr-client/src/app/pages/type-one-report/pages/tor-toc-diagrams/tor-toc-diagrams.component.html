      You can use the following SharePoint link to locate the Theory of Change (TOC) diagrams for inclusion in the
      annual Type 1 Technical Report. Please be aware that these diagrams are exports from the TOC Board/Module, as of
      January 29, 2024. A graphic designer will enhance their visual presentation before inclusion in the report. In the
      folder, you'll discover the Initiative-level TOC diagram intended for insertion under Section #2 of the Type 1
      Report. Additionally, there are individual diagrams for each Work Package for insertion in Section #3 of the Type
      1 Report.Â
