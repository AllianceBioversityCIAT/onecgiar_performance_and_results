      You can use the following SharePoint link to locate the Theory of Change (ToC) diagrams 
      for inclusion in the annual Type 1 report (paste them in the report). 
      Please be aware that these diagrams are exports from the ToC Board/Module, 
      as of late February 2024. In the folder, you'll discover the Initiative-level TOC diagram 
      intended for insertion under Section #2 of the Type 1 report. Additionally, 
      there are individual diagrams for each Work Package for insertion in Section #3 of the Type 1 report.
      A graphic designer will enhance their visual presentation and you will receive 
      the designed version of the ToC diagrams by email early March, for final review and 
      validation before inclusion (by PPU) in the final version of the report (in the PDF version of the report).
